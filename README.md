### Net Zero Carbon Markets

[The problem with net-zero emissions targets](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-the-problem-with-net-zero-emissions-targets)

Combining emissions reductions and negative emissions into a single target of reaching “net-zero” may create problems including delayed emissions cuts, but also insufficient focus on developing negative emissions technologies.

Net zero target is based on two responses: stop emitting GHGs, and remove CO2 using "negative emissions technologies" (NETS). NETs are not ready at scale (technically, economically or politically) and may have unintended consequences, including land use changes, excuses to delay mitigation due to investment in unproven technologies, and legitimizing 'continued aviation and fossil fuel extraction'. 

> Perhaps we should consider breaking these two objectives apart, and creating independent incentivization structures for them? i.e. both should be maximized. Author suggests this later - "insist on formal separation of negative emissions targets and accounting for emissions reduction, rather than combining them in a single “net-zero” goal."
