# Web3 Spatial Prototype 1: Sustainability-linked loan

## Outcomes:

Design a deck / wireframes depicting the **user journey** through the process of getting and repaying a sustainability-linked loan. 

Sketch out the technical architecture of the system, including what is going on behind the scenes, i.e. the satellite imagery - analytics - oracle - smart contract flow of information.


## Long Term Goals:

- Goal / target: COP26 Glasgow.
- Present pilot next gen carbon market findings.
- Reduce projected deforestation rates in the Amazon by x%.
- A farmer makes a living by regenerating natural capital.
- It makes economic sense for companies not to pollute.
- Tie financial incentives to carbon mitigation and earth regenerative efforts.
- Competitive rates + environmental impact.
- All countries of the world adopt the X Protocol. (Global standard for _____.)
    - Establish an ecological state protocol for measuring carbon sequestration efforts.
    - Hyperaware: autonomous vehicle governance protocol.
- Plant a billion trees. Sequester a teraton of carbon.
- <1.5C warming
- My grandchildren's grandchildren live.

## How could we fail?

- Users don't adopt our products at scale - firms don't want to take green defi loans.
- We can't raise the capital. There's no money to lend. We can't find collateral.
- To not achieve competitive rates.
- What we're trying to do is illegal / not politically feasible and governments shut us down.
- Solution is too complex. People can't understand. We can't build it. Gas costs
- Blockchain turns people off.
- Not adequately decentralized? Is blockchain required?
- A competitor pollutes the river to gain a competitive advantage.
- The wrong person gets paid for the pro-environmental actions of someone else.
- Someone cleans a street and just dumps it on the next street, which is unmonitored or someone else's.

## Questions

- What is the premium consumer (debtors) would be willing to pay for a green loan vs a regular loan? What discount would investors be willing to take for investing in green capital pools?
- How do we establish the right language so people understand the offering?
- What would the impacts of "dirty finance" / "dirty loans" being morally condemned? -or- How do we inspire a nation and a planet to promote a worthy cause?
- How can we incentivize businesses and consumers properly?
- How do we judge what the right things to incentivize are?
- How can we attribute environmental behavior to the right individuals?
- How does Brexit create an opening for piloting a next gen carbon market? ;)
- How do we prevent delinquency when borrowers don't put up collateral?

## Customers and Key Players

**Lenders.** Conscious green investors. Impact investors. Lotteries? Donors.

**Borrowers.** Small businesses with collateral that can make some measurable environmental impact through their operations.

## Process

1. Acme Paper applies for a loan to build a new factory.
2. Lender assesses application and identifies opportunities for sustainability incentives. (Energy. GHG. Water quality. Quality of life.)
3. Figure out the terms of the loan. (How do we value the potential environmental benefit?)
4. Loan is transferred to the borrower.
5. Periodic payments and analysis of environmental observations. (BFLO?)
6. Borrower completes payments.

## Ending

Acme Paper has a new plant. They don't pollute because it would cost too much, and they want to be compliant with regulations. The environmental health of the river has been sustained.
