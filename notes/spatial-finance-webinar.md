### Dr Ben Caldecott

Spatial finance is a term coined at Oxford: the integration of geospatial data and analysis into financial theory and financial practice.

Emerging due to technology changing rapidly.

Related sets of innovation:

EO and rapid developments in EO. High resolution photos. New constellations of satellites. Launch costs are falling. Higher resolution, higher revisit times, more spectra from imagery. Driven by public and private sector. EU, ESA commitments. Collecting terabytes of data each day.
Analytics – AI and data science. Ability to interpret that imagery quickly to derive insights. Processing power, storage, new algorithms. Neural networks, computer vision, etc, to train the algos to identify
Some capabilities are being used by financial institutions, but in pretty niche use cases. Trading use cases – how many containers in a port, how much oil in facilities, etc. Or let’s look at how many cars are parked at shopping malls and work out if we can discern economic activity.

Use cases are much broader and more powerful, which result from tying what you see through the imagery to ownership.

Coming at this – to minimize environmental and social impacts assets have on the world and minimize the chance that assets become stranded.

Is the Bloomberg terminal what you would use if you’re going to start doing spatial finance? This is an area that might be ripe for disruption.

Also – bigger than ESG data. A bigger structural change in the sorts of datasets people use to execute

Spatial Finance Initiative – Oxford, Satellite Applications Catapult, Turing Institute, Green Finance Institute. Missions: mainstream capabilities of geospatial data into financial decision-making globally.

Starting in the UK because there are not that many places that can combine finance, sustainability, EO and AI / data science capabilities.

By 2025: the world’s largest financial institutions will all be using spatial finance to assess risk, opportunities and impacts.

Also want to support the adoption and emergence of ‘spatial reporting’, another aspect to the reporting frameworks that exist. TCFD reporting.

Want this to be an established research area. More academic rather than practitioner questions about how to apply these datasets. How they can be used to test different theories in finance.

Support a vibrant ecosystem of different providers, particularly those in the UK ecosystem at the forefront of spatial finance adoption, innovation and research.

Create the applications that will be commercially helpful. Would be surprised at the gap between EO / AI and the finance community.

GeoAsset project: making asset-level data publicly available – who owns them etc.

How does this connect to the financial system? How does it benefit?

Satellite Applications Catapult. Independent non-profit innovation center. Promote the use of satellite data cross sectors.

Working lots in extractives, infrastructure and transport, health, agriculture, maritime.

Finance is relatively new. See that uptake of data and AI processing is increasing in physical sectors – but lagging in finance sector besides insurance and commodity trading.

Start by making the case that satellite data is relevant for finance and sustainable financial decision-making in general.

ESG data and sustainability data – quality, reliability, interoperability issues. Satellite data is a source of data that are inherently complementary to these disclosures.

As a source of data, it is much more neutral an objective. Provides an observation, rather than a disclosure.

Coverage: global. Capture data of any place on the planet. Quite complementary to disclosures that are not mandatory.
Comparability: data from the same satellite is comparable over time and across space. Addresses lack of standards.

Satellite data is available more frequently and more timely. Better than an annual sustainability report.

Qualities of the data make it a great complement to disclosures.

Example: heat risk at the postcode level. Come up with heat hazard risk scores – also for wildfires, flooding. Being used by emergency services for local planning. A better understanding of physical climate risk.

Using satellites to track fishing vessels and identify when they’ve entered zones they’re not allowed to enter, for example marine protected areas. Track movements, understand patterns of behaviour that are suspicious. Understand which vessels have been engaged with illegal transhipment.

Range of social and biodiversity risks by collecting data and analysing in a clever way.

Used by coast guard and retailers in supply chain and compliance. Can be data relevant to investors, sovereign bond issuers with reliance on fisheries, etc.

Years of satellite imagery has been analysed to create risk profile of farm areas. Interesting in emerging markets where low quality. Informs insurance and credit decisions in emerging markets, to give them a rich historical time series of a range of indicators. Useful to create pools of data where previously there were none.

Applications for geospatial data are nearly endless – from micro-micro asset levels to regional, national and global levels as well.

This data is already out there – being collected every day, being used every day. Means that as a sustainable investor you don’t have to wait for companies to disclose their sustainability impacts. Enables a more proactive approach.

Asset-level connection to metainformation is key. Allows observational satellite data to be linked to the financial sector. Asset-level data is crucial. Would be where disclosures could be useful. Invesstors could put more pressure on companies to disclose where their assets are, where their supply chains are located, where are they sourcing from. Would allow a proper, bottom up fundamental analysis of these things.

Without disclosures we are finding ways to collect asset-level data. SFI is creating asset level dataset for cement and steel sectors. Using ML and automated web scraping techniques deployed on disclosures, online dbs and satellite imagery to identify all cement and stell plants in the world, and link with owners. Exact location, production features (capacity, age) that give insight into the climate transition risk. Risk of a stranded asset.
